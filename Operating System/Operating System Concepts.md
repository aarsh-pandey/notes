Here are the **most critical OS concepts** that come up in technical interviews:

## **Core Memory Management**

- [ ] **Virtual Memory** - How it works, why it's needed
- [ ] **Paging vs Segmentation** - Differences and use cases
- [ ] **Memory allocation algorithms** - First fit, best fit, worst fit
- [ ] **Memory leaks** - What causes them, how to prevent
- [ ] **Stack vs Heap** - When each is used, how they differ

## **Process Management**

- [ ] **Process vs Thread** - Key differences (this is asked constantly!)
- [ ] **Process states** - New, ready, running, waiting, terminated
- [ ] **Context switching** - What happens, why it's expensive
- [ ] **Process scheduling algorithms** - FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, Priority
- [ ] **Deadlock** - Conditions, prevention, detection, recovery
- [ ] **Race conditions** - What they are, how to avoid

## **Synchronization**

- [ ] **Mutex vs Semaphore** - When to use each
- [ ] **Producer-Consumer problem** - Classic interview question
- [ ] **Critical section** - What it is, how to protect it
- [ ] **Dining Philosophers problem** - Another classic

## **File Systems**

- [ ] **File allocation methods** - Contiguous, linked, indexed
- [ ] **Directory structures** - How files are organized
- [ ] **File permissions** - Unix-style permissions (rwx)
- [ ] **Journaling** - How modern file systems ensure consistency

## **CPU Scheduling**

- [ ] **Preemptive vs Non-preemptive** scheduling
- [ ] **Scheduling algorithms comparison** - Pros/cons of each
- [ ] **Starvation** - What causes it, how to prevent
- [ ] **Convoy effect** - Problem with FCFS scheduling

## **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**

- [ ] **Pipes, Message queues, Shared memory**
- [ ] **Sockets** - How processes communicate over networks
- [ ] **Signals** - How processes notify each other

## **Common Interview Questions:**

1. "Explain the difference between a process and a thread"
2. "What is deadlock and how can you prevent it?"
3. "How does virtual memory work?"
4. "Compare different CPU scheduling algorithms"
5. "What happens during a context switch?"
6. "Explain the producer-consumer problem and its solution"
7. "What's the difference between mutex and semaphore?"

## **Practical Knowledge:**

- **Linux/Unix commands** - ps, top, kill, chmod, etc.
- **System calls** - fork(), exec(), wait(), malloc()
- **Performance monitoring** - Understanding CPU, memory usage

**Pro Tip:** Don't just memorize definitions. Understand **why** each concept exists and what problems it solves. Interviewers love when you can explain the reasoning behind OS design decisions!

Focus on **processes/threads, memory management, and synchronization** - these three areas cover about 70% of OS interview questions.
