## Study Tips

1. **Practice Daily:** Aim for 1-2 hours daily rather than long weekend sessions
2. **Code Along:** Don't just read - type out every example
3. **Build Projects:** Apply what you learn immediately in small projects
4. **Debug Actively:** When code breaks, figure out why instead of just copying solutions
5. **Use Multiple Resources:** Combine tutorials, documentation, and practice platforms

## Recommended Resources

- **Interactive Learning:** freeCodeCamp, Codecademy, JavaScript.info
- **Practice:** LeetCode (easy problems), Codewars, HackerRank
- **Documentation:** MDN Web Docs (mozilla.org)
- **Books:** "Eloquent JavaScript" by Marijn Haverbeke
- **YouTube:** Traversy Media, The Net Ninja, Programming with Mosh

## Assessment Checkpoints

Test yourself at key milestones:

- Can you write functions that solve simple problems?
- Can you manipulate arrays and objects confidently?
- Can you handle asynchronous code without getting confused?
- Can you build a simple interactive webpage?

Complete this path thoroughly before moving to Node.js. Each concept builds on previous ones, so don't rush ahead if you're not comfortable with earlier topics.
