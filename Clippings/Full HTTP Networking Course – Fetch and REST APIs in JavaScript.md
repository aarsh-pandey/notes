Master the HTTP networking protocol by completing over 80 coding exercises and quizzes in JavaScript. Once you’ve learned it all, we’ll build a real web crawler using Node.js to put all the concepts into practice.  
  
HTTP is the backbone of the modern web, and in this course we’ll do a deep dive into all of the fundamentals you’ll need to know to master web networking. We’ll use the Fetch API to interact with a live RESTful server in order to connect the different components of a video game.
