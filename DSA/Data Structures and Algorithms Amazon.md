## There are 4 modules in this course

In this module, you'll delve into fundamental data structures in Java, including Arrays, ArrayLists, LinkedLists, Stacks, and Queues. You'll start by understanding the basics of Arrays, focusing on their efficiency and limitations. Then, you'll explore ArrayLists and LinkedLists to learn how these dynamic data structures offer flexibility in managing collections of data. You'll also cover Stacks and Queues, mastering their use in scenarios that require Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) and First-In-First-Out (FIFO) operations, respectively. This module equips you with essential skills to effectively implement and utilize these data structures in real-world applications.

I learnt very new things as a beginner but there are more topics like Trees, Graphs, more sorting and searching algorithms that are not covered, so besides it, the course is good.
